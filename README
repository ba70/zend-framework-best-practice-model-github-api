== Zend Framework Module for GitHub's API ==
A best practice example of how to use zend framework (ZF) with Dependency Injection (DI) through the following
layers: dao, entity, mapper & service layer. Including full unit tests with boundary conditions & mocks/stubs included.

== Structure Overview ==
DAO: Data access object (i.e. webservice, database, mock etc)
Entity: Domain objects (i.e. User, Repo etc)
Mapper: Maps external data from DAO to internal entity (hidrates)
Service: Business logic




Any suggestions / ideas / improvememts welcome...
